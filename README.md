# Flight-Management-JavaFX-App
This is a simple JavaFX-based desktop application for managing flight schedules. It loads flight data from CSV files, allows filtering, sorting, and reordering flights based on timing. Additionally, it communicates with a simple Java-based server using TCP sockets.

Features
- Load flight data from .csv files.
- View and sort flights by flight number, departure time, duration, etc.
- Filter flights by type (Commercial, Private, etc.).
- Move "late" flights to the end of the queue.
- Communicate with a mock server for scheduling updates.

Project Status
This group project was created as a learning exercise during my early Java education. While not fully production-ready, it demonstrates my ability to work with GUI, data processing, and basic networking in Java.

This project was done in group.
**This is a beginner-level project and still under improvement.**
